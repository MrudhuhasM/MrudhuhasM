### 👋 Hi, I’m @Mrudhuhas

I'm a passionate individual interested in cutting-edge fields like **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. My fascination with algorithms and computational models is complemented by my strong foundation in **Mathematics**.

#### 🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently delving deeper into **Computer Vision**, exploring various algorithms, frameworks, and tools that enable machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. I'm excited to engage in projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in this domain.

#### 💻 Technologies & Tools

- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **Languages:** Python, C++,
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, scikit-learn, NLTK
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks

#### 🤝 Collaboration

I’m actively looking to collaborate on **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** projects. Whether you are a student, researcher, or a professional, I believe that collaborative work can lead to innovation and excellence. Feel free to reach out if you have an idea or need a committed team member for your project.

#### 📚 Continuous Learning

Apart from my primary interests, I also strive to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in **Machine Learning**, **NLP**, and the broader **AI** spectrum. Continuous learning is a core part of my professional journey, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges.
